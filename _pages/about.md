I am an environmental epidemiologist. I am currently a <a href='https://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/55' target="_blank">post-doctoral research fellow</a> at the <a href='https://www.earth.columbia.edu/' target="_blank">Earth Institute</a>, Columbia University, mentored by <a href='https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/mk3961' target="_blank">Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou</a> at the Mailman School of Public Health.

I am primarily interested in understanding the impact that climate, weather, and air pollution have on mortality, nutrition and disease outcomes, and how these impacts may be different in sub-groups of a population. I am also interested in developing new (particularly Bayesian) statistical methods, relevant to these concerns. 

I also aim to use my research capacity to pursue linked goals of social and climate justice.

In 2019, I earned my Ph.D from Imperial College London, where I was supervised by <a href='http://globalenvhealth.org/' target="_blank">Majid Ezzati</a> and <a href='https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.toumi' target="_blank">Ralf Toumi</a>. I also hold an undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Oxford. 

In summer 2017, during my studies, I interned at the <a href='https://public.wmo.int/en' target="_blank">World Meteorological Organisation</a>, a constituent part of the United Nations, in Geneva, Switzerland. While interning, I became a founding member of the <a href='http://ghhin.org/' target="_blank">Global Heat Health Information Network</a>.

I very much enjoy communicating my work to the public, and have been involved in several recent outreach projects, including in summer 2019 with <a href='https://www.greatexhibitionroadfestival.co.uk/event/green-space/?backto=whats-on' target="_blank">GREEN SPACE</a>. 

I have also just received seed funding as PI from the highly competitive <a href='https://www.earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/Research/Earth_Frontiers_Call_for_Proposals_2019.pdf' target="_blank">Earth Frontiers</a> 2019 call, where I submitted a grant application along with world-renowned scientists at Columbia for projects covering 2020-2021.

Oh, and I'm a musician, with my band <a href='https://www.glitchesmusic.co.uk/' target="_blank">Glitches</a> and as a <a href='https://soundcloud.com/rmiparks' target="_blank">sound artist</a>.
