excerpt: 'Weather and climate can strongly influence health. Short‐term weather phenomena, such as heat waves, can in the worst cases result in death. Long‐term evolution in climatic conditions may lead to a loading of the ‘climate dice’, resulting in extreme weather events becoming more common, while also shifting present spatial and temporal disease patterns. In a world of shifting weather regimes, such changes could have profound implications on public health.'

Weather and climate can strongly influence health. Short‐term weather phenomena, such as heat waves, can in the worst cases result in death. Long‐term evolution in climatic conditions may lead to a loading of the ‘climate dice’, resulting in extreme weather events becoming more common, while also shifting present spatial and temporal disease patterns. In a world of shifting weather regimes, such changes could have profound implications on public health.
